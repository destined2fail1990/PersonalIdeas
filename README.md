# PersonalIdeas
Any personal ideas from myself or any replaced name originating from me.

Its not about ownership, I just want a copy of what you do with it back.

Had 20 years of ideas stolen from me and while it hasn't been much of a problem in the past, it sucks getting screened out of a simple one with a 500 just incorporating it and making it mainstream.

Also requiring it given back to the community via open source.
