Any personal, conscious, ideas from myself or any replaced name originating from me.

Had 20 years of ideas stolen from me and while it hasn't been much of a problem in the past, it sucks getting screened out of a simple one with a 500 just incorporating it and making it mainstream.

Just requiring it given back to the community via open source.

Anything else must be ran past me. Any pain or suffering at the time of the idea voids this and entitles a lawsuit.

Special Notice: Trying to steal something from me to "build it for me" clearly not adhering to my culture or character is a waste of time and will likely result in me just destroying it and starting from the ground up. Regardless of cost. Dumping the source could be an effective way of doing this.
